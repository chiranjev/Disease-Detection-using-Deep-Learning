      <p>One of the most common cancer among the women in the world is the breast cancer. We were able to notice that it accounted for about 25% of all cancer cases and affected over 2.1 million people in 2015 alone. It usually starts when cells in the breasts begin to grow out of control. These cells tend to form tumors which can be seen via X-ray or even be felt as lumps in the breast areas.</p>
      <p>The chances of survival can significantly increase if it is diagnosed at an early stage. One of the key difficulties against breast cancer’s detection is whether how would we characterize tumors into being benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). A tumor can be viewed as benign if it does not invade adjacent tissue or spread to the alternate parts of the body in the manner in which cancerous tumors can. A threatening tumor's cells can develop into encompassing tissues or spread to remote areas of the body. Indeed, even benevolent tumors can go about as difficult issues on the off chance that they push on some imperative structures, for example, nerves or veins.</p>

Due to previously conducted surveys, we have found out that there are several cases where the incident of unintentional medical errors are between 10% and 17%. There is also a probability where the problems in the reports are not directly identifiable by the doctors and can be only detected using advances computational search. Some important details like the medical history will be overlooked by the doctors when they are diagnosing.</p>
